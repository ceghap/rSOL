# rSOL

> Remote Sleep-On-LAN 

Lock, Sleep, Start/Stop PlexService.

Currently only support Windows. macOS and Linux will follow later.


## Requirement / Dependencies

```
$ npm i connect serve-static node-arp
```


## Usage
You can navigate to the page using a web browser or simply calling the url using curl. I use this method for my HASS.
```bash
curl http://<ip>:<port>/<function>
```


## API

### /lockwin

Locks the machine.

Throws an `Error` if executing the lock command fails or if the OS is not supported.


### /tdoqla

Put the machine to sleep

Return "OK" or otherwise "KO" should any error occurs.


### /startplex

Start the PlexService

Return "OK" or otherwise "KO" should any error occurs.


### /stopplex

Start the PlexService

Return "OK" or otherwise "KO" should any error occurs.



##  Running as service


### Bundling rSOL.js and run as windows service using nssm

```bash
pkg -t node6-win rSOL.js
```
A bundled exe file will be created. eg. rSOL.exe
Note that pkg@4.4.6 may not generate the binaries. Downgrade it to version 4.3.8.


### Installing as windows service

Using nssm to install rSOL as service

```bash
nssm install rSOL rSOL.exe
```

Check the windows service manager and start the rSOL service.
By default the endpoint would be listening at ```http://127.0.0.1/<function>```
