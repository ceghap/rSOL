# rSOL

> Remote Sleep-On-LAN

Lock, Sleep, Start/Stop PlexService.

Currently only support Windows. macOS and Linux will follow later.

## Getting started

```
$ npm i -g pkg@4.3.8 && npm i
```

## Usage

You can navigate to the page using a web browser or simply calling the url using curl. I use this method for my HASS.

```bash
curl http://<ip>:<port>/<function>
```

## API

### /lockwin

Locks the machine.

Throws an `Error` if executing the lock command fails or if the OS is not supported.

### /tdoqla

Put the machine to sleep

Return "OK" or otherwise "KO" should any error occurs.

### /shutdown

Shutdown the machine

Return "OK" or otherwise "KO" should any error occurs.

### /reboot

Reboot the machine

Return "OK" or otherwise "KO" should any error occurs.

### /startplex

Start the PlexService

Return "OK" or otherwise "KO" should any error occurs.

### /stopplex

Start the PlexService

Return "OK" or otherwise "KO" should any error occurs.

## Running as service

### Bundling rSOL.js and run as windows service using nssm

```bash
pkg rSOL.js
```

A bundled exe file will be created. eg. rSOL-win.exe

### Installing as windows service

Using nssm to install rSOL as service

```bash
nssm install rSOL rSOL-win.exe
```

Check the windows service manager and start the rSOL service.
By default the endpoint would be listening at `http://<ip address>/<function>`
